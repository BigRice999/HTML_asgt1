      <h3>📖 About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate in <strong>Software Engineering and Web Design</strong>, with a passion for building visually appealing, user-focused websites that combine design and functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a naturally curious mind and love for continuous learning, I enjoy exploring the latest front-end technologies, trends, and tools to elevate user experience and interface design.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my university years, I thrived in combining creativity with code—whether it was through coursework, self-initiated design projects, or helping clubs enhance their online presence.
        This was evident in my coursework, self-initiated design projects, and contributions to various clubs by enhancing their online presence.

      <h2>🙋🏻‍♀️ What makes me unique 🙋🏻‍♀️</h2>      
      <li><strong>My ability to bridge creativity with logic: </strong>I see code not just as syntax, but as a canvas to express meaningful design.</li>
