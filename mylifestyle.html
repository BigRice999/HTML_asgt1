          <p>Reading is one of my favorite ways to slow down and recharge my creativity. I enjoy reading a wide variety of books, especially those related to personal growth, technology, and creative storytelling. </p>
          <p>But it‚Äôs not all serious reading! I also enjoy manga, recently, I‚Äôve been captivated by </p> 
            <p></p><em>Frieren: Beyond Journey‚Äôs End.</em>
          <p>It‚Äôs not your typical action fantasy, the storyline starts at it is quietly explores what happens after the heroic journey ends.
              What touched me most is the way it captures the passage of time and the loneliness that comes with 
              outliving people you once journeyed with. Through subtle moments and gentle storytelling, it reminds me that even in a fantasy world, 
              emotions like grief, memory, and quiet growth are beautifully human.</p>

          <p>Reading helps me gain new perspectives and stay inspired in both design and life. 
              During busy days, I often switch to podcasts or audiobooks to make use of small moments.</p>

          <strong>üéÆ Gaming</strong>
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>As a passionate gamer, I regularly follow trends and innovations in the gaming industry. I‚Äôm especially interested in game UI/UX design, story-rich indie games, and how interactive design enhances player experience.</p>
          <p><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> 
            is one of my all-time favorite games, I believe that I am not alone!</p>

          <p>Even years after its release, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> remains a masterpiece 
            that continues to amaze both new and returning players. 
            It‚Äôs not just about defeating enemies or completing quests, 
            it‚Äôs about the freedom to explore, experiment, and get creative in a vast open world, Hyrule, that truly feels alive.</p>

          <p>From a technical perspective, what fascinates me the most is how the game balances a physics-driven environment 
            with player creativity. Almost everything you see or interact with follows real-world logic: 
            wind can carry fire, metal conducts electricity, and even rolling objects can create chain reactions. 
            These systems aren‚Äôt just visual gimmicks ‚Äî they‚Äôre the foundation of gameplay. 
            Players can solve puzzles in dozens of ways, often in ways the developers didn‚Äôt even plan. </p>

          <p>Its seamless loading system, weather effects, and stamina-based climbing mechanics also 
            inspired many newer open-world games. Yet even today, it still manage to replicate feeling of true freedom.
            The game doesn't hold your hand makes it feel so rewarding. </p>

          <p>I think part of its lasting appeal also comes from how players continue to discover new interactions, 
            glitches, and fun mechanics years later. It‚Äôs a playground for experimentation!</p>

          <p>Here's a fun video that shows just how crazy and creative the community can get:</p>
